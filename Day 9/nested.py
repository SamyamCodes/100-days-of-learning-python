# Dictionary in List
# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.

# Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.

# add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
# add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
# You've visited Russia 2 times.

# You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. You need to create a function that modifies it.

# travel_log = [
# {
#   "country": "France",
#   "visits": 12,
#   "cities": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"]
# },
# {
#   "country": "Germany",
#   "visits": 5,
#   "cities": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"]
# },
# ]
# #🚨 Do NOT change the code above

# #TODO: Write the function that will allow new countries
# #to be added to the travel_log. 👇

# def add_new_country(country, times, cities):
#   print(f"You have visited {country} {times} times.")
#   print(f"You've been to {cities[0]} and {cities[1]}.")          # This is doing as the output suggested above.
