#For Loop with Lists
fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
for fruit in fruits:    >> taking list of fruits and assigning name fruit to each of them.

  print(fruit)
  print(fruit + " Pie")  >> Indentation makes sure you are inside the for loop.

print(fruits)     >> This line is out of the for loop.


for item in list_of items:
   #Do something to each team.

#Use loop for completely independently from lists.

Range function:
for number in range(a, b):
  print(number)

eg in range(1, 10)
ouptup>> 1 to 9 only. 10 is not included.
range(1, 11)
output>> 1 to 10.

for number in range(1, 11, 3): # 3 represents step size 
  print(number)
 Output>>1
 4
 7
 10
 (here, the steps are increased by 3).

total=0
for number in range(1, 100):
  total += number
print(total)
ans>>> 5050.
