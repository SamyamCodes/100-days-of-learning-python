import random  >>>This is a module which we are importing to generate random number.
It's important to use this module at first before using random.randint(1.10) to generate random numbers from 1 to 10, each time you run the program.


code:

import random
random_integer= random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_integer)  >>> Output: any random no. between 1 to 10

What is module?
>> It is different parts of a single something big part.
You can just create a my_module.py file and code 
pi=3.144445644

Now in your mainfile main.py, if you use
import my_module
print(my_module.py)
>> It prints 3.144445644 as output in your main.py file


random_float= random.random()
# This random.random() generates random number from [0,1) only in float.
print(random_float)


randomFloat= random.random()*5
print(random_float) >>>> It prints random no. in float from 0.000000 to 4.999999999
We can just multiply random.random() by any number if we want to increase its range.


love_score= random.rand(1, 100)
print(f"Your love scoe is {love_score}")
>>> Generates random numbers from 1 t 100.
