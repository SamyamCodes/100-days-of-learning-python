import random  >>>This is a module which we are importing to generate random number.
It's important to use this module at first before using random.randint(1.10) to generate random numbers from 1 to 10, each time you run the program.


code:

import random
random_integer= random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_integer)  >>> Output: any random no. between 1 to 10

What is module?
>> It is different parts of a single something big part.
You can just create a my_module.py file and code 
pi=3.144445644

Now in your mainfile main.py, if you use
import my_module
print(my_module.py)
>> It prints 3.144445644 as output in your main.py file


random_float= random.random()
# This random.random() generates random number from [0,1) only in float.
print(random_float)


randomFloat= random.random()*5
print(random_float) >>>> It prints random no. in float from 0.000000 to 4.999999999
We can just multiply random.random() by any number if we want to increase its range.


love_score= random.rand(1, 100)
print(f"Your love scoe is {love_score}")
>>> Generates random numbers from 1 t 100.



For data structures see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

List :
always start with[ and end with] in between comma(,)
eg:
fruits =[item1, item2]
fruits=["Cherry", "Apple", "Banana"]

Nested Lists
fruits=["Strawberry", "Apple", "Mango", "Banana", "Cherry"]
vegetables=["Spinach", "Potato","Garlic","Spinach", "Tomato"]
dirty_dozes=[fruits, vegetables] >>>> This is nested list.


my_list = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]

selected_list = my_list[3 - 1] # [7,8,9]
selected_list[2-1] = "X" #[7, 8, 9] => [7, X, 9]


print(my_list)
